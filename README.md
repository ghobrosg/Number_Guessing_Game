# Number_Guessing_Game

With the use of C++, I made a number guessing game. First, the user enters the number of tries he would like in order to guess the number. Then the user enters his guess, and if it is too high, the program will tell him his guess is too high. If the guess is too low, the program will tell him it is too low. The user will then keep guessing until he gets the right number. I created this program using the while loop in C++. Now, it's your turn to guess the number :).
